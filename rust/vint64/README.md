`vint64` is an implementation of a variable-length encoding for 64-bit
little endian integers which optimizes for simplicity and performance.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

This crate implements a variable-length encoding for 64-bit little endian
integers with a number of properties which make it superior in almost every
way to other variable-length integer encodings like [LEB128], SQLite "Varuints",
or CBOR:

- Capable of expressing the full 64-bit integer range with a maximum of 9-bytes
- Total length of a `vint64` can be determined via the first byte alone
- Provides the most compact encoding possible for every value in range
- No loops involved in decoding: just (unaligned) loads, masks, and shifts
- No complex branch-heavy logic: decoding is CTZ + shifts and sanity checks

Some precedent for this sort of encoding can be found in the
[Extensible Binary Meta Language] (used by e.g. the [Matroska]
media container format), however note that the specific type of "vint"
used by that format still requires a loop to decode.
